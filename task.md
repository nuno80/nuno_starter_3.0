## Directory Structure Changes

```

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ChunkLoadError
- **Problem**: Webpack chunk loading issues causing the application to fail
- **Solution**: Created proper .env.local file with Clerk environment variables and restarted the development server

### 2. TypeError: Failed to fetch
- **Problem**: Server action or API call failures due to incorrectly formatted environment variables
- **Solution**: Cleaned up the .env.local file to remove duplicates and fixed formatting issues

## What's Missing / Future Improvements

### 1. Database Schema
- The `database/schema.sql` file is still empty and needs to be populated with the appropriate tables for the agency's needs
- Currently contains only: `-- database/schema.sql\n\n-- crea qui le tue tabelle per la nuova app`

### 2. Advanced Functionality
- Form submission handling (currently forms are frontend-only)
- User dashboard functionality for authenticated users
- Admin panel features for managing services and bookings
- Email notification system for contact form submissions

### 3. Content Management
- All content is currently hardcoded and would benefit from a CMS integration
- Image optimization for better performance
- SEO enhancements

### 4. Additional Pages
- Blog or news section
- Team member profiles
- Testimonials/Reviews page
- Privacy policy and terms of service pages

### 5. Enhanced Features
- Booking system for services
- Calendar integration for event scheduling
- Payment processing for services
- Client portal for managing bookings

## Next Steps

1. **Database Setup**: Define the necessary tables in `database/schema.sql` for storing:
   - Services information
   - Bookings and inquiries
   - Client information
   - Team member profiles
   - Testimonials

2. **Form Handling**: Implement backend functionality for:
   - Contact form submissions
   - Service booking requests
   - User registration and authentication

3. **Content Management**: Consider integrating a CMS for easier content updates

4. **Performance Optimization**: 
   - Optimize images
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Add loading states for better UX

5. **Testing**: 
   - Unit tests for components
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - Cross-browser compatibility testing

## How to Run the Website

1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2. Configure environment variables in `.env.local` (Clerk keys required for full functionality)
3. Initialize database: `pnpm run db:migrate`
4. Run development server: `pnpm dev`
5. Access at: http://localhost:3000

## Conclusion

The Nuova agenzia website has been successfully implemented with a professional design that matches the original website. All core pages have been created with responsive layouts, and technical issues have been resolved. The website is ready for further development and content management.
